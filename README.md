# Dynamic Build System

## Problem Statement

Systems to rebuild formatted documents from source always seem to do too much work, or too little.

They do too much work when they respond to a minor edit by making you wait for unrelated chapters to be re-parsed and re-formatted. 

But they can also rebuild too little, leaving you with an inconsistent final product.

The problem outlined above is not specific to Sphinx. Not only does it haunt other document systems, like LaTeX, but it can even plague projects that are simply trying to direct compilation steps with the venerable make utility, if their assets happen to cross-reference in interesting ways.

As the problem is ancient and universal, its solution is of equally long lineage:

```bash
$ rm -r _build/
$ make html
```

If you remove all of the output, you are guaranteed a complete rebuild! 

Some projects even alias rm -r to a target named clean so that only a quick make clean is necessary to wipe the slate.

---

## Approach Proposed

What if your build system were a persistent process that noticed every chapter title, every section title, and every cross-referenced phrase as it passed from the source code of one document into the text of another? 

Its decisions about whether to rebuild other documents after a change to a single source file could be precise, instead of mere guesses, and correct, instead of leaving the output in an inconsistent state.

The result would be a system like the old static make tool, but which learned the dependencies between files as they were built â€” that added and removed dependencies dynamically as cross references were added, updated, and deleted.

----

## Example
### Render a directory of cross-referenced blog posts as HTML using DynamicBuildSystem

```python
import os
import re
from IPython.nbconvert import HTMLExporter
from IPython.nbformat import current as nbformat
from docutils.core import publish_doctree, publish_parts
from docutils import nodes
from glob import glob
from jinja2 import DictLoader

from contingent.projectlib import Project
from contingent.io import looping_wait_on

dl = DictLoader({'full.tpl': """\
{%- extends 'display_priority.tpl' -%}
{% block input scoped %}<pre>{{ cell.input }}</pre>
{% endblock %}
{% block pyout scoped %}<pre>{{ output.text | ansi2html }}</pre>
{% endblock %}
{% block markdowncell scoped %}{{ cell.source  | markdown2html }}
{% endblock %}
"""})
